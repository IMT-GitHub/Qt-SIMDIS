/**
 *  @page scserver A simple DCSServer example
 *
 *  Simple server program implemented from the DCSServer extension 
 *  class API.  The extension class makes using the DCS API much 
 *  simpler, but also introduces implementation limitations that
 *  require the DCS server to work in a single-threaded/serial 
 *  processing mode.  This type of server may not handle multiple 
 *  connections very well.  A concurrent/multi-threaded server can 
 *  be implemented from the raw DCS API for handling multiple 
 *  simultaneous connections.
