<p>The DCS API is a C++ software library developed by the Tactical Electronic Warfare
Division at the Naval Research Laboratory.  The API is the software
implementation of a system for sending data to Simdis for display, distributed
as part of the Simdis 3D Visualization and Display package.&nbsp; The API
transmits predefined data types to Simdis using two standard Internet Protocols
(IP).&nbsp; These Internet Protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).</p>
<p>TCP is a protocol for reliably transmitting data from one
point to another.&nbsp; All data sent via TCP is guaranteed to arrive at its
destination, in the order in which it was sent.&nbsp; This protocol requires a
significant amount of overhead to reliably deliver information in sequence, and
no one piece of information can be delivered before any of its
predecessors.&nbsp; Examples of applications that utilize the Transmission
Control Protocol are web browsers and email programs.&nbsp; DCS uses TCP to
transmit important information such as initialization and state modification
data types. &nbsp;</p>
<p>UDP is a non-reliable Internet Protocol that uses what can
be described as a &quot;fire and forget&quot; approach to data
transmittal.&nbsp; UDP data is not guaranteed to arrive at its destination in
sequence, or even to arrive at its destination at all.&nbsp; Some examples of
applications that utilize the User Datagram Protocol are network timeservers,
domain name servers, and network video games.&nbsp; DCS uses UDP to transmit
information such as position updates, which are only valid during a specific
time frame.&nbsp; This type of data typically arrives at a very high rate, and
the infrequent loss of data is negligible when compared with the significant
amount of overhead required to reliably transmit the data in sequence.</p>

<p>DCS is supplied as source code only. This means that you have to compile the
package for yourself.&nbsp; The following is a list of other software you will
need or is recommended to build this package:</p>

<p>This library is only distributed in C++ form.  To use this library, you must
build it on your own machine.  The exact steps to build the source may vary based on the
operating system and compiler, but the overall method is the same.  This page describes
the steps required for the Plug-in API version 1.11 and later.
<ol>
<li>Download and extract the DCS2 Library ZIP or TGZ from the <a href="https://simdis.nrl.navy.mil">SIMDIS web site</a>.
<li>Run CMake to configure and generate either a solution file (Visual Studio) or makefile (UNIX makefiles)
 <ul>
  <li>Start <a href="http://cmake.org">CMake</a>
    <ul>
     <li>Windows users should find a shortcut in their start menu after installation
     <li>Linux users can run cmake-gui for the X-Windows interface, or ccmake for the curses interface
    </ul>
  <li>Locate the DCSSoftware/ directory in the field "Where is the source code"
  <li>Specify a build location in "Where to build the binaries".  Note that CMake supports and encourages out-of-source builds, but it is not required.
  <li>Click <b>Configure</b>.  You may be asked to select your compiler version
   <ul>
    <li>Windows users may wish to select one of:
    <ul>
     <li>Visual Studio 9 2008  <em>(win32_vc-9.0)</em>
     <li>Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64  <em>(win64_vc-9.0)</em>
     <li>Visual Studio 10  <em>(win32_vc-10.0)</em>
     <li>Visual Studio 10 Win64  <em>(win64_vc-10.0)</em>
    </ul>
    <li>UNIX users may wish to select Unix Makefiles
   </ul>
  <li>Optionally set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable.  If run, the "make install" will copy headers
      and libraries into this location.  You can ignore this if you do not plan on compiling the install target.
  <li>Click <b>Configure</b> again to lock in any changes, then click <b>Generate</b>.
 </ul>
 <li>On Windows, a solution file is generated in the directory specified in "Where to build the binaries."  Run Visual Studio to build.
 <li>On Linux, makefiles are generated in the directory specified in "Where to build the binaries."  Run make to build.
</ol>

<p>Programs designed to work with the DCS API are required to include the 'DCS.h' header
file. &nbsp;This file includes all of the necessary DCS, NET, and other
miscellaneous header files required for the implementation of a DCS
application. &nbsp;These header files define all of the types and functions
provided by the DCS API. &nbsp; Any C++ source file that makes use of the DCS
API must include this line:</p>

  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

</div>
<br>
<p>Programs designed to work with the DCS API
must also be linked with the proper DCS and NET library files. &nbsp;For
Microsoft Windows based applications, these libraries are DCS.lib and NET.lib,
and for UNIX based applications these libraries are libDCS.a and libNET.a.
&nbsp;Microsoft Visual Studio users can link their applications with these
libraries by adding them to the &quot;Object/library modules&quot; text field
from the &quot;Link&quot; tab of the project settings dialog. &nbsp;UNIX
makefile users can link their applications with these libraries by adding -lDCS
and -lNET to the linker options.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an
example, we have provided two sample server programs and a sample client
program.&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs are found under
<b>DCS2</b> in the following sub-directories:</p>
